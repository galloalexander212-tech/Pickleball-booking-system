                How do I book a court?
            </h3>

            <p>
                Log in, hit <strong>BOOK A COURT</strong> (or browse the
                Courts page), pick your court and date, then tap a free
                time slot and confirm. Your booking appears on your
                My Account page right away.

            <h3>
                Why does my booking say PENDING?
            </h3>

            <p>
                New bookings are reviewed by our admins. Once approved,
                the status flips to <strong>CONFIRMED</strong> — you'll
                see it change on My Account.

            <p>
                Yes — go to My Account → MY BOOKINGS → CANCEL.

                players.

                Hit <strong>JOIN</strong> on any event card. Slots are
                first come, first served — full events show FULL.
                You can leave an event anytime from My Account before

                Court slots are reserved on a first come, first served
                basis. A booking is pending until confirmed by an admin.
